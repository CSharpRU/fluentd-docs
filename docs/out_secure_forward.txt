# Secure Forward Output

The `out_secure_forward` output plugin sends messages via **SSL with authentication** (c.f. [in_secure_forward](in_secure_forward)).

##Example Configurations

###Minimal configurations like this:

    <match secret.data.**>
      type secure_forward
      shared_key secret_string
      self_hostname client.fqdn.local
      <server>
        host server.fqdn.local  # or IP
        # port 24284
      </server>
    </match>

NOTE: Without hostname ACL (and it's not implemented yet), `self_hostname` is not checked in any state. `${hostname}` placeholder is available for such cases.

    <match secret.data.**>
      type secure_forward
      shared_key secret_string
      self_hostname ${hostname}
      <server>
        host server.fqdn.local  # or IP
        # port 24284
      </server>
    </match>

###Multiple forward destinations over SSL

When two or more `<server>...</server>` clauses are specified, this plugin uses these server nodes in a round-robin order. The servers with `standby yes` are NOT selected until all non-standby servers go down.

If a server requires username & password, set `username` and `password` in the `<server>` section:

    <match secret.data.**>
      type secure_forward
      shared_key secret_string
      self_hostname client.fqdn.local
      <server>
        host first.fqdn.local
        username repeatedly
        password sushi
      </server>
      <server>
        host second.fqdn.local
        username sasatatsu
        password karaage
      </server>
      <server>
        host standby.fqdn.local
        username kzk
        password hawaii
        standby  yes
      </server>
    </match>

To specify keepalive timeouts, use the `keepalive` parameter. For example, in the configuration below, SSL connection is disconnected and re-connected every hour. By default, `keepalive` is set to 0 and the connection does NOT get disconnected unless there is a connection issue (This feature is for DNS name updates and refreshing SSL common keys).

    <match secret.data.**>
      type secure_forward
      shared_key secret_string
      self_hostname client.fqdn.local
      keepalive 3600
      <server>
        host server.fqdn.local  # or IP
        # port 24284
      </server>
    </match>

##Parameters

####type
It is required and must be `secure_forward`.

####port (integer)
24284 by default

####bind (sring)
0.0.0.0 by default

####self_hostname (string)
Default value of the auto-generated certificate common name (CN)

####shared_key (string)
Optional shared key

####keepalive (time)

####allow_self_signed_certificate (bool)
`true` if sellf-signed CA is allowed. The default is `true`.

####ca_file_path (string)
The path to the certificate file.

####reconnect_interval (time)
The interval between SSL reconnects. 5 seconds by default.

####read_length (integer)
The number of bytes read per nonblocking read. The default value is 8MB=8*1024*1024 bytes.

####read_interval_msec (integer)
The interval between the non-blocking reads, in milliseconds. The default value is 50.

####socket_interval_msec (integer)
