* out_file

Dump time, tag and json record separated by a delimiter:

    :::text
    time[delimiter]tag[delimiter]record\n

Actual example is:

    :::text
    2014-06-08T23:59:40[TAB]file.server.logs[TAB]{"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}\n

`out_file` format has several options to customize the content.

    :::text
    delimiter SPACE   # Optional. "\t"(TAB) is used by default
    output_tag false  # Optional. Remove tag[delimiter] from the content. The default is false 
    output_time true  # Optional. Remove time[delimiter] from the content. The default is false

And you can set time and tag to the record by setting "include_tag_key" / "tag_key" and "include_time_key" / "time_key" options.
If you set following options:

    :::text
    include_time_key true
    time_key log_time  # default is time

then a record has log_time field.

    :::text
    {"field1":"value1","field2":"value2","log_time":"time string",...}

* json

Dump json record without time and tag:

    :::text
    {"field1":"value1","field2":"value2"}\n

`json` format also supports "include_xxx" options. See `out_file` section.
If you don't want to omit time or tag information, please set `include_xxx` options.

In addition, `json` format supports `time_as_epoche` option.
If this option is `true`, time value keeps a number, not formatted string.

* ltsv

Dump record as [LTSV](http://ltsv.org):

    :::text
    field1[label_delimiter]value1[delimiter]field2[label_delimiter]value2\n

`ltsv` format supports `delimiter` and `label_delimiter` options.

    :::text
    format ltsv
    delimiter SPACE   # Optional. "\t"(TAB) is used by default
    label_delimiter = # Optional. ":" is used by default

And `ltsv` format also supports "include_xxx" options. See `out_file` section.

* single_value

For in_tail's `none` format. Use one value in json, not entire record:

    :::text
    value1\n

`single_value` format accepts `add_newline` option.

     :::text
     add_newline false # default is true. If your value already has "\n", please set "false"
