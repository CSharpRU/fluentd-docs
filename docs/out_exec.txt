# exec Output Plugin

The `out_exec` Buffered Output plugin passes events to an external program as a tab-separated value (TSV) file. The program receives the path of a TSV file containing incoming events as its last argument.

## Example Configuration

`out_exec` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type exec
      command cmd arg arg
      keys k1,k2,k3
      tag_key k1
      time_key k2
      time_format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
    </match>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.
