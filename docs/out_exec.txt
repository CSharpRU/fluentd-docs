# out_exec Output Plugin

The `out_exec` buffered output plugin passes events to an external program as a tab-separated value (TSV) file. The command is passed the location of a TSV file containing incoming events as its last argument.

## Example Config

`out_exec` is included within Fluentd core. No extra installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type exec
      command cmd arg arg
      keys k1,k2,k3
      tag_key k1
      time_key k2
      time_format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

## Parameters

### type (required)
The value must be `exec`.

### command (required)
A command to execute. The exec plugin passes the path of a TSV file as the last argument.

### keys (required)
Comma-separated keys to use in the TSV file.

### tag_key
Name of the key to use as the event tag instead of the value in the event record.

### time_key
Name of the key to use as the event time instead of the value in the event record.

### time_format
Format for event time used when the `time_key` parameter is specified. Default is UNIX time (integer).

## Buffer Parameters
For advanced usage, you can tune Fluentd's internal buffering mechanism by these parameters.

### buffer_type (buffer_path)
`file` by default ([buf_file](buf_file)). You can use `memory` ([buf_memory](buf_memory)) as well. Please specify `buffer_path` when you're using `file` buffer.

### buffer_queue_limit, buffer_chunk_limit
The length of the chunk queue, and the size of each chunk. See [Buffer Plugin Overview](buffer-plugin-overview) for the basic buffer structure. Default is 256 and 8m. Suffixes “k” (KB), “m” (MB), “g” (GB) can be used.

### retry_wait and retry_limit
The interval between retries, and the number of retries. Default is 1.0 and 17. `retry_wait` gets doubled between each retry (e.g. the last retry waits for 131072 sec).
