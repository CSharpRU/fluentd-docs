# Before Installing Fluentd

You MUST follow these setups before installing Fluentd, otherwise you will have some troubles.

## Setup NTP

It's HIGHLY recommended to setup *ntpd* on the node. Otherwise your logs could contain invalid timestamps.

## Increase Max # of File Descriptors

Please increase maximum number of file descriptors. You can check the number by `ulimit -n` command.

    :::term
    $ ulimit -n
    65535

If your console shows `1024`, it's insufficient. Please add following lines to your `/etc/security/limits.conf` and reboot your machine.

    :::term
    root soft nofile 65536
    root hard nofile 65536
    * soft nofile 65536
    * hard nofile 65536

### Optimize Network Kernel Parameters

Please add these parameters to your /etc/sysctl.conf. Then, please type `sysctl -w` or reboot your node.

    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
    net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
    net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10240    65535
