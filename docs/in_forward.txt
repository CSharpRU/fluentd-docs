# forward Input Plugin

The `in_forward` Input plugin listens to a TCP socket to receive the event stream. It also listens to an UDP socket to receive heartbeat messages.

This plugin is mainly used to receive event logs from other Fluentd instances, the Fluent-cat command, or client libraries. This is by far the most efficient way to retrieve the records.

### Example Configuration

`in_forward` is included in Fluentd's core. No additional installation process is required.

    :::text
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
      bind 0.0.0.0
    </source>

NOTE: Please see the <a href="config-file">Config File</a> article for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `forward`.

#### port
The port to listen to. Default Value = 24224

#### bind
The bind address to listen to. Default Value = 0.0.0.0 (all addresses)

### Protocol

This plugin uses [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) for the internal protocol. MessagePack is a binary-based data serialization / deserialization library. `in_forward` accepts MessagePack data streams with the following structure.

    :::text
    stream:
      message...
    
    message:
      [tag, time, record]
      or
      [tag, [[time,record], [time,record], ...]]
    
    example:
      ["myapp.access", [1308466941, {"a"=>1}], [1308466942, {"b"=>2}]]
