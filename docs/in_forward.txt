# forward Input Plugin

The `in_forward` input plugin listens TCP socket to receive event stream, and also listens UDP socket to receive heartbeat message.

This plugin is mainly used to receive event logs from other fluentd, fluent-cat command or client libraries, because this is by far the most efficient way to retrieve the records.

### Example Config

`in_forward` is included within Fluentd core. No extra installation process is required.

    :::text
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
      bind 0.0.0.0
    </source>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `forward`.

#### port
The port to listen on. Default Value = 24224.

#### bind
The bind address to listen on. Default Value = 0.0.0.0 (all addresses)

### Protocol

This plugin uses [MessagePack](http://msgpack.org/) for the internal protocol. MessagePack is binary-based data serialization / deserialization library. The MessagePack data stream with the following structure will be accepted by `in_forward`.

    :::text
    stream:
      message...
    
    message:
      [tag, time, record]
      or
      [tag, [[time,record], [time,record], ...]]
    
    example:
      ["myapp.access", [1308466941, {"a"=>1}], [1308466942, {"b"=>2}]]
