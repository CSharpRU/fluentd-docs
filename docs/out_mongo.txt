# out_mongo Output Plugin

The `out_mongo` is a buffered output plugin to write records into [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/), the emerging document-oriented database system.

NOTE: If you're using ReplicaSet, please refer <a href="out_mongo_replset">out_mongo_replset</a>.

### Why Fluentd with MongoDB?

Compared to directly insert records from apps to MongoDB, Fluentd enables your application to insert records asynchronously with batch-insertion.

It has 1) less impact on application performance, and 2) more MongoDB insert throughput, while maintaining JSON record structure.

### Install

td-agent includes MongoDB plugin by default. For Fluentd gem users, you need to install fluent-plugin-mongo gem by the following command.

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-mongo

### Example Config

See [Store Apache Logs into MongoDB](apache-to-montodb) for more real-world example.

    # Single MongoDB
    <match mongo.**>
      type mongo
      host fluentd
      port 27017
      database fluentd
      collection test

      # for capped collection
      capped
      capped_size 1024m

      # authentication
      user michael
      password jordan

      # flush
      flush_interval 10s
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `mongo`.

#### host (required)
MongoDB hostname,

#### port (required)
MongoDB port.

#### database (required)
The database name.

#### collection (required, if not tag_mapped)
The collection name.

#### capped
Put this option if you want to use capped collection. This is always recommended because MongoDB is not suitable for storing large amount of historical data.

#### capped_size
Set capped collection size.

#### user
The username for authentication.

#### password
The password for authentication.

#### tag_mapped
If you put this option, mongo output plugin uses Fluentd's tag to determine the destination collection.

For example, if you generate records 'mongo.foo', the records will be inserted into `foo` collection within `fluentd` database.

    :::text
    <match mongo.*>
      type mongo
      host fluentd
      port 27017
      database fluentd

      # Set 'tag_mapped' if you want to use tag mapped mode.
      tag_mapped

      # If tag is "mongo.foo", then prefix "mongo." is removed.
      # Collection name to insert is "foo".
      remove_tag_prefix mongo.

      # This configuration is used if tag not found. Default is 'untagged'.
      collection misc
    </match>

#### flush_interval
The interval time between the dataflush from fluentd to MongoDB. Default is 60 sec.
