# Performance Tuning

## Check top command

If Fluentd doesn't perform well as you expected, please check `top` command first. You need to identify which part of your system is the bottleneck (CPU? Memory? Disk I/O? etc).

## Multi Process

Fluentd often becomes CPU bottleneck for handling billions of incoming records. To utilize multiple CPU cores, using `in_multiprocess` is recommended.
