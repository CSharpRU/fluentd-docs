# Free Alternative to Splunk Using Fluentd

[Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) is a great solution for searching logs; the drawback of course is its cost. The combination of Kibana + ElasticSearch + Fluentd provides a free alternative to Splunk, with easy setup. :)

[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is an easy to use Search Engine. Meanwhile, [Kibana](http://kibana.org/) is a great Web UI for ElasticSearch that supports the LogStash format. The following procedure was tested on Mac OS X Mountain Lion.

## Prerequisites

### Java for ElasticSearch

    :::term
    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0_45"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_45-b06-451-11M4406)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.45-b01-451, mixed mode)

### Ruby for Kibana

    :::term
    $ ruby --version
    ruby 1.9.3p385 (2013-02-06 revision 39114) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1]

## Set Up ElasticSearch

Please download and extract the ElasticSearch package.

    :::term
    $ curl -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2.tar.gz
    $ cd elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2/

Then, start ElasticSearch.

    :::term
    $ ./bin/elasticsearch -f

## Setup Kibana

Download Kibana via the official webpage or clone its Github repository. Kibana is a Sinatra application.

    :::term
    $ git clone git://github.com/rashidkpc/Kibana.git
    $ cd Kibana
    $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle # "gem install bundle" is needed if you don't install bundle

Then, start Kibana. You can modify Kibana's configuration via KibanaConfig.rb.

    :::term
    $ bundle exec ruby kibana.rb

## Setup Fluentd (td-agent)

We'll first install td-agent, the packaged version of Fluentd.

* [Debian Package](install-by-deb)
* [RPM Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Ruby gem](install-by-gem)

Next, we need to install the ElasticSearch plugin for Fluentd: fluent-plugin-elasticsearch.

    :::term
    $ /usr/lib64/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch

Please modify `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` as shown below:

    :::text
    <source>
      type syslog
      port 42185
      tag syslog
    </source>

    <source>
      type forward
    </source>

    <match syslog.**>
      type elasticsearch
      logstash_format true
      flush_interval 10s # for testing
    </match>

fluent-plugin-elasticsearch provides a logstash_format option. It allows Kibana to search stored event logs in ElasticSearch. Finally, let's start td-agent.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start

## Setup rsyslogd

In our final step, we'll forward the logs from your rsyslogd to Fluentd. Please add the following line to your `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, and restart rsyslog. This will forward your local syslog to Fluentd, and Fluentd in turn will forward the logs to ElasticSearch.

    :::text
    *.* @127.0.0.1:42185

Please restart the rsyslog service once the modification is complete.

    :::text
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart

## Store and Search event logs

Once Fluentd receives some logs from rsyslog and has flushed them to ElasticSearch, you can search the stored event logs via Kibana by accessing [http://127.0.0.1:5601/](http://127.0.0.1:5601/) in your browser.

To manually send logs, please use the `logger` command.

    :::text
    $ logger -t test foobar

When debugging your td-agent configuration, using [out_copy](out_copy) + [out_stdout](out_stdout) will be useful. All the logs including errors can be found at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.log`.

    :::text
    <match syslog.**>
      type copy
      <store>
        # for debug (see /var/log/td-agent.log)
        type stdout
      </store>
      <store>
        type elasticsearch
        logstash_format true
        flush_interval 10s # for testing
      </store>
    </match>

## Conclusion

This article introduced using the combination of Fluentd and Kibana (with ElasticSearch) to achieve a free alternative to Splunk: storing and searching machine logs. The examples provided in this article have not been tuned. If you will be using these components in production, you may want to modify some of the configurations (e.g. JVM, ElasticSearch, Fluentd buffer, etc.) according to your needs.
