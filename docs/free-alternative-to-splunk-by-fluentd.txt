# Free Alternative to Splunk by Fluentd

[Splunk](http://www.splunk.com/) is a great solution for log search, except its cost. Kibana + ElasticSearch + Fluentd give you a free alternative of Splunk, with easy setup :)

[ElasticSearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/) is a easy to use Search Engine and [Kibana](http://kibana.org/) is a great Web UI for ElasticSearch with LogStash format. All of the following procedure was tested on Mac OS X Mountain Lion.

## Prerequisites

### Java for ElasticSearch

    :::term
    $ java -version
    java version "1.6.0_45"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_45-b06-451-11M4406)
    Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.45-b01-451, mixed mode)

### Ruby for Kibana

    :::term
    $ ruby --version
    ruby 1.9.3p385 (2013-02-06 revision 39114) [x86_64-darwin12.2.1]

## Setup ElasticSearch

Please downlod and extract the package.

    :::term
    $ curl -O https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2.tar.gz
    $ tar zxvf elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2.tar.gz
    $ cd elasticsearch-0.90.0.RC2/

Then, start ElasticSearch.

    :::term
    $ ./bin/elasticsearch -f

## Setup Kibana

Download via webpage or clone repository from github. Kibana is a Sinatra application.

    :::term
    $ git clone git://github.com/rashidkpc/Kibana.git
    $ cd Kibana
    $ bundle install --path vendor/bundle # "gem install bundle" is needed if you don't install bundle

Then, start Kibana. You can modify Kibana configuration via KibanaConfig.rb.

    :::term
    $ bundle exec ruby kibana.rb

## Setup Fluentd (td-agent)

Let's install td-agent, the packaged version of Fluentd first.

* [Debian Package](install-by-deb)
* [RPM Package](install-by-rpm)
* [Ruby gem](install-by-gem)

After that, we need to install fluent-plugin-elastic search.

    :::term
    $ /usr/lib64/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-elasticsearch

Please modify `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` like below:

    :::text
    <source>
      type syslog
      port 42185
      tag syslog
    </source>

    <source>
      type forward
    </source>

    <match syslog.**>
      type elasticsearch
      logstash_format true
      flush_interval 10s # for testing
    </match>

fluent-plugin-elasticsearch provides logstash_format option. It enables Kibana to search stored event logs in ElasticSearch. Finally, let's start td-agent.

    :::term
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent start

## Setup rsyslogd

Finally, let's forward the logs from your rsyslogd to Fluentd. Please add the following line to your `/etc/rsyslog.conf`, and restart rsyslog. This will forward your local syslog to Fluentd, and Fluentd forwards logs to ElasticSearch.

    :::text
    *.* @127.0.0.1:42185

rsyslog service must be restarted after the modification.

    :::text
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/rsyslog restart

## Store and Search event logs

After Fluentd receives some logs from rsyslog and flushed them to ElasticSearch, you can search the stored event logs via Kibana by accessing [http://127.0.0.1:5601/](http://127.0.0.1:5601/) by the browser.

To manually send the log, please use `logger` command.

    :::text
    $ logger -t test foobar

To debug the td-agent configuration, using [out_copy](out_copy) + [out_stdout](out_stdout) is useful. All the logs including errors are at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.log`.

    :::text
    <match syslog.**>
      type copy
      <store>
        # for debug (see /var/log/td-agent.log)
        type stdout
      </store>
      <store>
        type elasticsearch
        logstash_format true
        flush_interval 10s # for testing
      </store>
    </match>

## Conclusion

This article introduced a combination of Fluent and Kibana (with ElasticSearch) to achieve free alternative to Splunk: store and search the machine logs. Above example is no tuning. If you use these components in production, then maybe need to modify some configurations (e.g. JVM, ElasticSearch, Fluentd buffer and etc).
