# memory Buffer Plugin

The `memory` buffer plugin provides fast buffer implementation. It uses memory to store buffer chunks. Buffered events which can’t be written soon are deleted when fluentd is shut down.

### Example Config

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      buffer_type memory
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.
