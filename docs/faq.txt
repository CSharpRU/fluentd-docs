# FAQ

## Operations

### I have a weird timestamp value, what happened?

The timestamps of Fluentd and its logger libraries depend on your system's clock. It's highly recommended that you set up NTP on your nodes so that your clocks remain synced with the correct clocks.

### I installed td-agent and want to add custom plugins. How do I do it?

Please use `fluent-gem` as shown below.

    :::term
    $ /usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install <plugin name>

For example, issue the following command if you are adding `fluent-plugin-twitter`.

    :::term
    $ /usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-twitter

(If you can't find fluent-gem in the above directory, try looking in `/usr/lib64/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem`)

Now you might be wondering, "Why do I need to specify the full path?" The reason is that td-agent does not modify any host environment variable, including `PATH`. If you want to make all td-agent/fluentd related programs available without writing "/usr/lib/..." every time, you can add

    :::bash
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/

to your `~/.bash_profile`.

If you would like to find out more about plugin mangement, please take a look at the [Plugin Management](/articles/plugin-management) article.

### How can I match (send) an event to multiple outputs?

You can use the `copy` [output plugin](/articles/out_copy) to send the same event to multiple output destinations.

## Plugin Development
