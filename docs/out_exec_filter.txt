# out_exec_filter Output Plugin

The `out_exec_filter` buffered output plugin executes an external program, using events as input and reading new events from the program output. It passes tab-separated values (TSV) to stdin and reads TSV from stdout.

### Example Config

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type exec_filter
      command cmd arg arg
      in_keys k1,k2,k3
      out_keys k1,k2,k3,k4
      tag_key k1
      time_key k2
      time_format %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

The value must be `exec_filter`.

#### command (required)

#### in_keys (required)
Comma-separated keys to use from the incoming event for the TSV input to the command.

#### out_keys (required)
Comma-separated keys to use in processing the TSV output from the program.

#### tag_key
Name of the key to use as the event tag instead of the value in the event record.

#### time_key
Name of the key to use as the event time instead of the value in the event record.

#### time_format
Format of the event time used when the `time_key` parameter is specified. Default is UNIX time (integer).
