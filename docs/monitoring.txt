# Monitoring Fluentd

This article explains how to monitor the `Fluentd` daemon.

## Port Monitoring

Fluentd opens several ports according to the configuration file. We recommend checking the availability of these ports. The default port settings are shown below:

* TCP 0.0.0.0 8888 (HTTP by default)
* TCP 0.0.0.0 24224 (Forward by default)

### Debug Port

A debug port for local communication is recommended for trouble shooting. Please note that the configuration below will be required.

    :::text
    <source>
      type debug_agent
      bind 127.0.0.1
      port 24230
    </source>

You can attach the process using the `fluent-debug` command through dRuby.

## Process Monitoring

Two `ruby` processes (parent and child) are executed. Please make sure these processes are running. The example for `td-agent` is shown below.

    :::term
    /usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/ruby /usr/sbin/td-agent
      --daemon /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid
      --log /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
