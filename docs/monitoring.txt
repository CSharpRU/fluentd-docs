# Monitoring Fluentd

This article covers how to monitor the `fluentd` daemon.

## Port Monitoring

Fluentd opens the some ports depending on the configuration. We recommend checking the availability of these ports.

* TCP 0.0.0.0 8888 (HTTP by default)
* TCP 0.0.0.0 24224 (Forward by default)

### Debug Port

A debug port for local communication should be recommended for trouble shooting. The configuration below is required, though.

    :::text
    <source>
      type debug_agent
      bind 127.0.0.1
      port 24230
    </source>

You can attach the process by `fluent-debug` command, and execute command through dRuby.

## Process Monitoring

Two `ruby` processes (parent and child) are executed. Please make sure these processes are running. This is the exampel of `td-agent`.

    :::term
    /usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/ruby /usr/sbin/td-agent
      --daemon /var/run/td-agent/td-agent.pid
      --log /var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log
