#### log_level option (Fluentd v0.10.43 and above)

The `log_level` option allows the user to set different levels of logging for each plugin. Shown below is the list of supported values, in increasing order of verbosity:

* `fatal`
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `debug`
* `trace`

For example, in order to debug [in_tail](in_tail) but suppress all but fatal log messages for [in_http](in_http), their respective `log_level` options should be set as follows:

    <source>
        type tail
        log_level debug
        path /var/log/data.log
        ...
    </source>
    <source>
        type http
        log_level fatal
    </source>

NOTE: Although this option is supported for all plugins, certain plugins may still use the old-style, [global logging option](trouble-shooting#turn-on-verbose-logging). <a href="http://repeatedly.github.io/2014/02/new-log-level-parameter/">This blog article</a> explains how to update such plugins to the new log level system.
