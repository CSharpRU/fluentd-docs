#### log_level option (Fluentd v0.10.43 and above)

`log_level` allows the user to configure different levels of logging for each plugin.

`log_level` field takes one of the following six values, in the increasing order of verbosity:

* `fatal`
* `error`
* `warn`
* `info`
* `debug`
* `trace`

For example, in order to debug [in_tail](in_tail) but suppress all but fatal log messages for [in_http](in_http), `log_level` options should be set as follows:

    <source>
        type tail
        log_level debug
        path /var/log/data.log
        ...
    </source>
    <source>
        type http
        log_level fatal
    </source>

NOTE: Although this option is supported for all plugins, some plugins still use the old-style, global logger. For those "outdated" plugins, the `log_level` can't control logging verbosity until the plugin author updates their code to the new per-plugin logging style.
