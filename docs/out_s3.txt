# out_s3 Output Plugin

The `out_s3` is a buffered output plugin to write records into Amazon S3, the cloud object storage provided by Amazon.

### Install

td-agent includes S3 plugin by default. For Fluentd users, you need to install fluent-plugin-s3 gem by the following command.

    :::term
    $ fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-s3

### Example Config

See [Store Apache Logs into Amazon S3](apache-to-s3) for more real-world example.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type s3

      aws_key_id YOUR_AWS_KEY_ID
      aws_sec_key YOUR_AWS_SECRET/KEY
      s3_bucket YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
      s3_endpoint s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com
      path logs/
      buffer_path /var/log/fluent/s3

      time_slice_format %Y%m%d-%H
      time_slice_wait 10m
      utc
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

NOTE: The file won't be created after importing the first record. It's created hourly (depending on `time_slice_format`). Please be patient for the first time.

NOTE: Make sure you have <b>ENOUGH spaces on buffer_path</b> directory. People often run shoft of its space and have problems.
