At <a href="http://www.wishwall.me/">wishwall.me</a>, we started using Fluentd from early on to collect user event data. Its reliability and ease of use from application code (Python for us) make it easy for us to keep track of the key metrics. - Danny Zhang, co-founder

</p><br />

Data Science is at the core of <a href="http://gree-corp.com/">GREE</a>'s business, and it starts with logging user events and Advertisement related data. We currently deploy Fluentd for a number of our games and ad services to federate user event data, and use that data to inform our product decisions.

So far, we've been pleased with Fluentd's robustness and performance: it has held up strongly against our massive data, allowing us to focus on data analytics instead of logging. - Masaki Fujimoto, CTO

</p><br />

NHN Japan, based in Tokyo, is web services company. Log collection and analysis is one the most important missions in our day-to-day operations. As such we have spent quite a long time to search for the right tool that can process and collect data from various sources with great flexibility and high throughput -- and we came up with Fluentd.

We utilize Fluentd to collect a very large amount of logs. The logs are written into Hadoop HDFS clusters, and are also used to analyze various service statuses in realtime. We also use many plugins from rubygems.org to further enhance this mechanism. - Satoshi Tagomori

## PPLive, Inc.

<a href="http://www.pptv.com/">PPTV.com</a> is one of the largest Chinese online TV provider, which has 35 million active users. PPTV clients can be installed on multi-platforms (Windows, Mac, Android, iOS, WP, etc).

We (PPTV site operation team) tried to find a solution to do realtime log-collection and analyse based on the massive logfiles. Finally, we found that Fluentd is the perfect solution to do real-time log collection. Log can be JSON-structured to MongoDB cluster.

Realtime monitoring/reporting/charting can be generated from MongoDB data, which is helpful to our operation work. Fluentd is a great tool! - Xinyi Zhou
