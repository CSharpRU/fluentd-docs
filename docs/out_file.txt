# out_file Output Plugin

The `out_file` buffered output plugin writes events to files. By default, it writes into the file in daily basis (almost around 00:10). Before that, no files are created. If you want to output the logs hourly or minutely, please modify `time_slice_format` value.

### Example Config

`out_file` is included within Fluentd core. No extra installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type file
      path /var/log/fluent/myapp
      time_slice_format %Y%m%d
      time_slice_wait 10m
      time_format %Y%m%dT%H%M%S%z
      compress gzip
      utc
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `file`.

#### path (required)
Path of the file. Actual path becomes path + time + ”.log”. See also time_slice_format parameter descried below.

#### time_slice_format

Format of the time in the file path. Following characters are replaced with values:

* %Y: month of the year (01..12)
* %d: Day of the month (01..31)
* %H: Hour of the day, 24-hour clock (00..23)
* %M: Minute of the hour (00..59)
* %S: Second of the minute (00..60)

Default is `%Y%m%d` which splits files every day. Use `%Y%m%d%H` to split files every hour.

#### time_slice_wait
The time to wait old logs. Default is 10 minutes ('10m'). Specify larger value if old logs may reache.

#### time_format
Format of the time written in files. Default is ISO-8601.

#### utc
Uses UTC for path formatting. Default is localtime.

#### compress
Compress flushed files. Supported algorithm is `gzip`. Default is no-compression.

### Buffer
This output plugin uses [file buffer](buf_file) by default. You can use other buffer plugins as well.
