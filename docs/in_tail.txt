# in_tail Input Plugin

The `in_tail` input plugin allows Fluentd to read events from the tail of text files. Its behavior is similar to the `tail -F` command.

### Example Config

    :::text
    <source>
      type tail
      path /var/log/httpd-access.log
      tag apache.access
      format apache
    </source>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `tail`.

#### path (required)
Paths separated with ‘,’ to read. This parameter is required.

#### tag (required)
Tag of the event. This parameter is required.

#### format (required)
Format of the log. It’s name of a template or regexp surround by ‘/’.

Regexp must have at least one named captures (?&gt;NAME&lt;PATTERN). If the regexp has capture named ‘time’, it is used as a time of the event. You can specify format of the time using time_format parameter. If the regexp has capture named ‘tag’, tag parameter + captured tag is used as the tag of the event.

Following templates are supported:

* `apache`

Reads apache’s log file host, user, time, method, path, code, size, referer and agent fields. This template is same as following configuration:

    :::text
    format /^(?<host>[^ ]*) [^ ]* (?<user>[^ ]*) \[(?<time>[^\]]*)\] "(?<method>\S+)(?: +(?<path>[^ ]*) +\S*)?" (?<code>[^ ]*) (?<size>[^ ]*)(?: "(?<referer>[^\"]*)" "(?<agent>[^\"]*)")?$/
    time_format %d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S %z

* `syslog`

Reads syslog’s output file (e.g. /var/log/syslog) time, host, ident, message fields. This template is same as following configuration:

    :::text
    format /^(?<time>[^ ]* [^ ]* [^ ]*) (?<host>[^ ]*) (?<ident>[a-zA-Z0-9_\/\.\-]*)(?:\[(?<pid>[0-9]+)\])?[^\:]*\: *(?<message>.*)$/
    time_format %b %d %H:%M:%S

#### time_format
Format of the time field. This parameter is required only if the format includes ‘time’ capture and it can’t be parsed automatically. See [Time#strptime](TODO).

#### rotate_wait
in_tail does a bit more than `tail -F`. When one is rotating a file, there is a possibility that some data might still need to be written to the old file as opposed to the new one.

in_tail takes care of this by keeping a reference to the old file (even after it’s been rotated) for some time before transitioning to the new file entirely (so that the data designated for the old file don’t get lost). By default, this time interval is 5 seconds.

The rotate_wait parameter accepts a single integer which represents the number of seconds you want to set this time interval to.
