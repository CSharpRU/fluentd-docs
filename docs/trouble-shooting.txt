# Trouble Shooting Fluentd

## Look at Logs

If things aren't going as expected, please look at your logs at first. For td-agent (rpm/deb), the log is located at `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`.

## Turn on Verbose Logging

If you turn on verbose logging, you can get more information on the logs.

### rpm

Please 1) edit `/etc/init.d/td-agent`, 2) add `-vv` to TD_AGENT_ARGS, and 3) restart td-agent.

    :::term
    # at /etc/init.d/td-agent
    ...
    TD_AGENT_ARGS="... -vv"
    ...

### deb

Please 1) edit `/etc/init.d/td-agent`, 2) add `-vv` to DAEMON_ARGS, and 3) restart td-agent.

    :::term
    # at /etc/init.d/td-agent
    ...
    DAEMON_ARGS="... -vv"
    ...

### gem

Please add `-vv` to your command line.

    :::term
    $ fluentd .. -vv
