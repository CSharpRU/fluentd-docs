# Cloud Data Logger by Raspberry Pi

[Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a credit-card-sized single-board computer. Because it is low-cost and easy to equip various types of sensors, using Raspberry Pi as cloud data logger is one of the ideal use cases.

This article introduces how to transport sensor data from Raspberry Pi to the cloud, by using Fluentd data collector. For the cloud side, we'll use [Treasure Data](http://go.treasuredata.com/fluentd) cloud data service as an example, but you can use any cloud services in theory.

## Install Raspbian

[Raspbian](http://www.raspbian.org/) is a free operating system based on Debian optimized for the Raspberry Pi. Please follow the instruction from these blog articles, and install Raspbian to your Raspberry Pi.

- [Getting Started with Raspberry Pi: Installing Raspbian](http://www.andrewmunsell.com/blog/getting-started-raspberry-pi-install-raspbian)

## Install Fluentd

Next, let's install Fluentd on to your Raspbian. Raspbian bundles Ruby 1.9.3 by default, and we need the extra development package to install Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ sudo aptitude install ruby-dev

Then, let's install Fluentd and necessary plugins.

    :::term
    $ sudo gem install fluentd
    $ sudo fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-td

## Configure and Launch Fluentd

Please sign up to Treasure Data from [sign up page](https://console.treasuredata.com/users/sign_up). Treasure Data offers free plan to store and analyze millions of data points. From the users page, you can get the API key of your account.

Then, please prepare `fluentd.conf` file with the following contents. Please don't forget to put your API key.

    :::text
    <match td.*.*>
      type tdlog
      apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
 
      auto_create_table
      buffer_type file
      buffer_path /home/pi/fluentd/td
    </match>
    <source>
      type http
      port 8888
    </source>
    <source>
      type forward
    </source>

Finally, please launch Fluentd within your terminal.

    :::term
    $ fluentd -c fluent.conf

## Upload Test

To test the configuration, just post the JSON to Fluentd via HTTP.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"sensor1":3123.13,"sensor2":321.3}' \
      http://localhost:8888/td.testdb.raspberrypi

NOTE: Are you using Python? Please check how to use fluentd's <a href="python">python logger</a> library.

Finally, please access to the databases page to check if your data is uploaded to the cloud correctly.

* [Treasure Data: List of Databases](https://console.treasuredata.com/databases)

You can now issues queries against the imported data.

* [Treasure Data: New Query](https://console.treasuredata.com/query_forms/new)

For example, these queries calculate the average sensor1 value, and the sum of sensor2 value.

    :::sql
    SELECT AVG(sensor1) FROM raspberrypi;
    SELECT SUM(sensor1) FROM raspberrypi;


## Conclusion

Raspberry Pi is an ideal platform to prototype the data logger hardware. Fluentd helps Raspberry Pi to transfer the collected data to the cloud easily and reliably.
