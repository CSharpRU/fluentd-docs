# Fluentd rpm Installation

This article describes how to install td-agent rpm package, the stable distribution package of fluentd maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://www.treasure-data.com/).

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for the flexibility, but the installation and the operation of Ruby daemon have some difficulties for the casual users. That's why Treasure Data, Inc. is providing the stable distribution of Fluentd, called `td-agent`. The detailed difference between fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](faq#what-is-the-difference-with-td-agent-and-fluentd).

## Step1: Install from rpm Repository

Executing [install-redhat.sh](http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/sh/install-redhat.sh) will install td-agent on your machine. Currently, CentOS, RHEL 5.0+ are supported.

    $ wget -qO- http://toolbelt.treasure-data.com/sh/install-redhat.sh | sh

NOTE: It's HIGHLY recommended to setup <b>ntpd</b> on the node. Otherwise your logs could contain invalid timestamps.

## Step2: Launch Daemon

`/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start 
    Starting td-agent: [  OK  ]
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status
    td-agent (pid  21678) is running...

These commands are supported.

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent status

Please make sure **your configuration file** is located at `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf`.

## Step3: Put Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and routes them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post the sample log records by curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
