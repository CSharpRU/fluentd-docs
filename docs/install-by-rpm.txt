# Fluentd rpm Installation

This article describes how to install td-agent rpm package, the stable distribution package of fluentd maintained by [Treasure Data, Inc](http://treasure-data.com/).

## What is td-agent?

Fluentd is written in Ruby for the flexibility, but the installation and the operation of Ruby daemon have some difficulties for the casual users. That's why Treasure Data, Inc. is providing the stable distribution of Fluentd. The detailed difference between fluentd and td-agent can be found [here](http://community.fluentd.org/a/what-is-the-difference-with-td-agent-and-fluentd/).

## Step1: Add the rpm Repository

This article shows how to install td-agent for CentOS, RHEL 5.0+. At first, please create `/etc/yum.repos.d/td.repo` with the following contents.

    :::term
    [treasuredata]
    name=TreasureData
    baseurl=http://packages.treasure-data.com/redhat/$basearch
    gpgcheck=0

## Step2: Install and Launch

Then, you can install via `yum` command.

    :::term
    $ yum update
    $ yum install td-agent
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start

`/etc/init.d/td-agent` script is also provided to start, stop, or restart the agent.

    :::term
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent start
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent stop
    $ /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

## Step3: Put Sample Logs via HTTP

By default, `/etc/td-agent/td-agent.conf` is configured to take logs from HTTP and routes them to stdout (`/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log`). You can post the sample log records by curl command.

    :::term
    $ curl -X POST -d 'json={"json":"message"}' http://localhost:8888/debug.test
