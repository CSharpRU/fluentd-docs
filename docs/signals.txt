# Signal Handling
This article explains how `fluentd` handles UNIX signals.

## Process Model
When you launch Fluentd, it creates two processes: supervisor and worker process. The supervisor process controls the life cycle of the worker process. Please make sure you'll send the signals to the supervisor process.

## Signals

### SIGINT or SIGTERM
Stop the daemon gracefully. The memory buffer is tried to be flushed at once, but no retry in case of failure. The file buffer is not flushed, but the logs are persisted on the disk by default.

### SIGUSR1
Force flushing the buffered logs, and reopening fluentd's log. All buffers including memory and file will be flushed. The memory buffer is tried to be flushed at once, but no retry in case of failure.

### SIGHUP
Reloading the configuration file, by gracefully restarting the worker process. The memory buffer is tried to be flushed but no retry in case of failure. The file buffer is not flushed, but the logs are persisted on the disk by default.
