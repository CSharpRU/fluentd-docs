# Data Import from Perl Applications

'[Fluent::Logger](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-perl)', is a library to post records from Perl applications to Fluentd. This article explains how to use the Fluent::Logger library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Perl
  * Basic knowledge of Fluentd
  * Perl 5.10 or higher

## Installing Fluentd

Please refer the following documents to install fluentd.

* [Install Fluentd by RPM](install-by-rpm) (td-agent)
* [Install Fluentd by Deb](install-by-deb) (td-agent)
* [Install Fluentd by Gem](install-by-gem)

## Modifying Config File

Next, please ensure to have [in_forward](in_forward) source within your configuration file.

    :::text
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match fluentd.test.**>
      type stdout
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    # for rpm/deb only
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

## Using Fluent::Logger

First, install the *[Fluent::Logger](http://search.cpan.org/dist/Fluent-Logger/)* library via CPAN.

    :::term
    $ cpan
    cpan[1]> install Fluent::Logger

Next, initialize and post the records as follows.

    :::perl
    # test.pl
    use Fluent::Logger;
    my $logger = Fluent::Logger->new(
        host => '127.0.0.1',
        port => 24224,
        tag_prefix => 'fluentd.test',
    );
    $logger->post("follow", { "entry1" => "value1", "entry2" => 2 });

Execute the script, and that will fire the logs into Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ perl test.pl

The logs should be emitted to `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log` or stdout of Fluentd process, via [out_stdout](out_stdout).

## Production Deployments

### Output Plugins
Various [output plugins](output-plugin-overview) are available to write records into other places:

* Examples
  * [Store Apache Log into Amazon S3](apache-to-s3)
  * [Store Apache Log into MongoDB](apache-to-mongodb)
  * [Data Collection into HDFS](http-to-hdfs)
* List of Plugin References
  * [Another Fluentd](out_forward)
  * [MongoDB](out_mongo) or [MongoDB ReplicaSet](out_mongo_replset)
  * [Hadoop](out_webhdfs)
  * [File](out_file)
  * [etc...](http://fluentd.org/plugin/)

### High-Availablability Configurations of Fluentd
For high-traffic websites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using a high availability configuration of td-agent. This will improve data transfer reliability and query performance.

### Monitoring
Monitoring Fluentd itself is also important. Please refer this document about general monitoring methods for td-agent.
