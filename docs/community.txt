#### Contribute
An Open Source project like Fluentd couldnâ€™t exist without contributions from the developer community. Let's take a look at our source code repository and issue list, and consider submitting a patch.

Like the program itself, we run the documentation as an open source project. The sources are available on Github, and we encourage you to make improvements, whether big or small, make a pull request.
