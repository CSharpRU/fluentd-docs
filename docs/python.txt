# Data Import from Python Applications

'[fluent-logger-python](http://github.com/fluent/fluent-logger-python)', is a library to post records from Python applications to Fluentd. This article explains how to use the fluent-logger-python library.

## Prerequisites

  * Basic knowledge of Python
  * Basic knowledge of Fluentd
  * Python 2.6 or higher

## Installing Fluentd

Please refer the following documents to install fluentd.

* [Install Fluentd by RPM](install-by-rpm) (td-agent)
* [Install Fluentd by Deb](install-by-deb) (td-agent)
* [Install Fluentd by Gem](install-by-gem)

## Modifying the Config File

Next, please ensure to have [in_forward](in_forward) source within your configuration file.

    :::text
    <source>
      type forward
      port 24224
    </source>
    <match fluentd.test.**>
      type stdout
    </match>

Please restart your agent once these lines are in place.

    :::term
    # for rpm/deb only
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/td-agent restart

## Using fluent-logger-python

First, install the fluent-logger library via pip.

    :::term
    $ pip install fluent-logger

Next, initialize and post the records as follows.

    :::python
    # test.py
    from fluent import sender
    from fluent import event
    sender.setup('fluentd.test', host='localhost', port=24224)
    event.Event('follow', {
      'from': 'userA',
      'to':   'userB'
    })

Execute the script, and that will fire the logs into Fluentd.

    :::term
    $ python test.py

The logs should be emitted to `/var/log/td-agent/td-agent.log` or stdout of Fluentd process, via [out_stdout](out_stdout).

## Production Deployments

### Output Plugins
Various [output plugins](output-plugin-overview) are available to write records into other places:

* Examples
  * [Store Apache Log into Amazon S3](apache-to-s3)
  * [Store Apache Log into MongoDB](apache-to-mongodb)
  * [Data Collection into HDFS](http-to-hdfs)
* List of Plugin References
  * [Another Fluentd](out_forward)
  * [MongoDB](out_mongo) or [MongoDB ReplicaSet](out_mongo_replset)
  * [Hadoop](out_webhdfs)
  * [File](out_file)
  * [etc...](http://fluentd.org/plugin/)

### High-Availablability Configurations of Fluentd
For high-traffic websites (more than 5 application nodes), we recommend using a high availability configuration of td-agent. This will improve data transfer reliability and query performance.

### Monitoring
Monitoring Fluentd itself is also important. Please refer this document about general monitoring methods for td-agent.
