# Store Apache Logs into Riak

This article explains how to use Fluentdâ€™s Riak Output plugin ([out_riak](https://github.com/kuenishi/fluent-plugin-riak)) to aggregate semi-structured logs in real-time.

## Prerequisites

1. You are on OSX or Linux
2. Riak is already installed and running
3. You have an Apache web server log

## Installing Fluentd and the Riak output plugin

If you already have `gem` (Rubygems command line tool) installed, you can install Fluentd with the following command.

    :::term
    $ gem install fluentd

Also, Treasure Data packages Fluentd as `td-agent` for the [deb](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/install-by-deb) and [rpm](http://docs.fluentd.org/articles/install-by-rpm) packaging systems.

We also need to install the [Riak plugin](https://github.com/kuenishi/fluent-plugin-riak) so that we can output data to a Riak node. This is as easy as running

    :::term
    $ gem install fluent-plugin-riak

(If you are using td-agent, you can run `/usr/lib/fluent/ruby/bin/fluent-gem install fluent-plugin-riak` to install the same plugin.)

## Configuring Fluentd

Create a configuration file called `fluent.conf` and copy and paste the following lines into it:

    <source>
      type tail
      format apache2
      path /var/log/apache2/access_log
      pos_file /var/log/fluentd/apache2.access_log.pos
      tag riak.apache
    </source>

    <match riak.**>
      type riak
      buffer_type memory
      flush_interval 5s
      retry_limit 5
      retry_wait 1s
      nodes localhost:8087 # Assumes Riak is running locally on port 8087
    </match>

The `<source>...</source>` section tells Fluentd to tail an Apache2-formatted log file located at `/var/log/apache2/access_log`. Each line is parsed as an Apache access log event and tagged with the `riak.apache` label.

The `<match riak.**>...</match>` matches all events whose tags start with `riak.` and sends it to a Riak node located at `localhost:8087`. You can send events to multiple nodes like `nodes host1 host2 host3` as well.

## Testing

Launch Fluentd with the following command:

    :::term
    $ fluentd -c fluentd.conf

Do make sure you have correct file access permissions so that you can read the Apache log file and write to `/var/log/fluentd/apache2.access_log.pos` (sudo-ing might help).

Now, you should start seeing data into your Riak cluster. We can check that by hitting Riak's HTTP API:

    :::term
    $ curl http://localhost:8098/buckets/fluentlog/keys?keys=true
    {"keys":["2014-01-23-d30b0698-b9de-4290-b8be-a66555497078", ...]}
    $ curl http://localhost:8098/buckets/fluentlog/keys/2014-01-23-d30b0698-b9de-4290-b8be-a66555497078
    [
      {
        "tag": "riak.apache",
        "time": "2004-03-08T01:23:54Z",
        "host": "64.242.88.10",
        "user": null,
        "method": "GET",
        "path": "/twiki/bin/statistics/Main",
        "code": 200,
        "size": 808,
        "referer": null,
        "agent": null
      }
    ]

There it is! (the response JSON is formatted for readability)
