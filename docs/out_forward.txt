# out_forward Output Plugin

The `out_forward` buffered output plugin forwards events to other fluentd servers. This plugin supports load-balancing and automatic fail-over (a.k.a. active-active backup). If you want replication, use copy plugin described below.

It detects fault of a server using “φ accrual failure detector” algorithm. You can customize parameter of the algorithm. When a fault server recovers, the plugin makes it available automatically after several seconds.

### Example Config

`out_forward` is included within Fluentd core. No extra installation process is required.

    :::text
    <match pattern>
      type forward
      send_timeout 60s
      recover_wait 10s
      heartbeat_interval 1s
      phi_threshold 8
      hard_timeout 60s
      
      <server>
        name myserver1
        host 192.168.1.3
        port 24224
        weight 60
      </server>
      <server>
        name myserver2
        host 192.168.1.4
        port 24224
        weight 60
      </server>
      ...
      
      <secondary>
        type file
        path /var/log/fluent/forward-failed
      </secondary>
    </match>

NOTE: See <a href="config-file">Config File</a> for the basic structure and syntax of the configuration file.

### Parameters

#### type (required)
The value must be `forward`.

#### &lt;server&gt; (required at least one)
Destination servers. Each server must have following information.

* *name*: Name of the server. This parameter is used in error messages.
* *host* (required): IP address or host name of the server. This parameters is required.
* *port*: Port number of the host. Default is 24224. Note that both TCP packets (event stream) and UDP packets (heartbeat message) are sent to this port.
* *weight*: Weight of load balancing. For example, weight of a server is 20 and weight of the other server is 30, events are sent in 2:3 raito. Default is 60.

#### &lt;secondary&gt;
Backup destination which is used when all servers are not available. This parameter is optional.

#### send_timeout
Timeout time to send event logs. Default is 60 seconds.

#### recover_wait
Wait time before accepting recovery of a fault server. Default is 10 seconds.

#### heartbeat_interval
Interval of heartbeat packer. Default is 1 second.
phi_threshold
Threshold parameter to detect fault of a server. Default is 8.

#### hard_timeout
Hard timeout to detect failure of a server. Default is same as the send_timeout parameter.

## Trouble Shooting

### "no nodes are available"
Please check you can communicate with port 24224 by **not only TCP, but also UDP**. These commands will be useful for checking the network configuration.

    :::term
    $ telnet host 24224
    $ nmap -p 24224 -sU host

There exists one [known issue](http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2019944) that VMware sometimes losts small UDP packages which are used for heartbeat.
