# Fluentd Source Installation

This article describes how to install Fluentd from source code (git repository). This is useful for developers.

## Step1: Install Ruby interpreter

Please install Ruby >= 1.9.2 on your local environment.

## Step2: Fetch Source Code

Fetch the source code from github. Official repository is located [here](http://github.com/fluent/fluentd/).

    :::term
    $ git clone https://github.com/fluent/fluentd.git
    $ cd fluentd

## Step3: Build and Install

Build the package by `rake` and install it by `gem`.

    :::term
    $ rake build
    Successfully built RubyGem
    Name: fluentd
    Version: xxx
    File: fluentd-xxx.gem
    $ gem install pkg/fluentd-xxx.gem

## Step4: Run

To confirm that Fluentd was installed successfully, run the following commands:

    :::term
    $ fluentd --setup ./fluent
    $ fluentd -c ./fluent/fluent.conf -vv &
    $ echo '{"json":"message"}' | fluent-cat debug.test

The last command sends Fluentd a message ‘{“json”:”message”}’ with a “debug.test” tag. If the installation was successful, Fluentd will output the following message:

    :::term
    2011-07-10 16:49:50 +0900 debug.test: {"json":"message"}
