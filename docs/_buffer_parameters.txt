## Buffer Parameters
For advanced usage, you can tune Fluentd's internal buffering mechanism with these parameters.

### buffer_type
The buffer type is `memory` by default ([buf_memory](buf_memory)). The `file` ([buf_file](buf_file)) buffer type can be chosen as well. The `path` parameter is used as `buffer_path` in this plugin.

### buffer_queue_limit, buffer_chunk_limit
The length of the chunk queue and the size of each chunk, respectively. Please see the [Buffer Plugin Overview](buffer-plugin-overview) article for the basic buffer structure. The default values are 64 and 8m, respectively. The suffixes “k” (KB), “m” (MB), and “g” (GB) can be used for buffer_chunk_limit.

### flush_interval
The interval between data flushes. The default is 60s. The suffixes “s” (seconds), “m” (minutes), and “h” (hours) can be used.

### retry_wait, retry_limit and max_retry_wait
The interval between write retries, and the number of retries. The default values are 1.0 and 17, respectively. `retry_wait` doubles every retry (e.g. the last retry waits for 131072 sec, roughly 36 hours), and `max_retry_wait` may be used to limit the maximum retry interval.

### num_threads
The number of threads to flush the buffer. This option can be used to parallelize writes into the output(s) designated by the output plugin. The default is 1.
